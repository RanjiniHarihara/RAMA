        Sri Madhwacharya has played a vital role in the renaissance of vaidika Hindu philosophy along with 2 other Acharyas Sri Sankara and Sri Ramanuja and particularly resurrection of a pracheena Dwaitha sidhantha (dualism). He is believed to be the avatara of Vayu. He was born as Madhwa only to reestablish the supremacy of Dwaitha sidhantha over the extant religions of his day. He was born on the auspicious day of Vijaya-dasami(Dussehra) into Madhyageha family due to persistence penance by his parents at Sri Anantheswara temple at Udupi. He was named as Vasudeva by his parents and he started his gurukula under his father at pajaka shetra, a village about 18 km from Udupi, on the Udupi Mangalore road.
        
          During his childhood days, Vasudeva exhibited extraordinary talent for grasping all spiritual teachings. He was drawn to the path of renunciation and even as a boy of eleven years, he was intiated into monastic order by Achyutha Prekcha Achar, a reputed ascetic of the time, near Udupi. The preceptor Achyutha Prekcha Achar gave the boy Vasudeva the name of Sri Ananda Tirtha at the time of his initiation into sanyasa.

        Sri Vyasaraja is the great exponent in Dwaitha sidhantha. He was born in the year 1447, into the family of old couple Balanna and Lakshmi of Kashyapa gothra, thanks to the blessings of Sri Veda Vyasa and Sri Brahmanya Tirtha. He was introducted into saint hood in the year 1454 by Sri Brahmanya Tirtha. Later he was sent to Sri Padaraja for further studies. In other words, Sri Padaraja was his vidya guru.

        His works on Dwaitha sidhantha such as Tatparya Chandrika, Nyaya Mrutha, Tarka Tandava are very popular in negating the other schools of thoughts of the day. Hence he was known as Chandrikacharya.

        Sri Vyasaraja was the raja guru of Krishna devaraya and he saved the king from imminent death due to Kuha yoga, by ascending the throne of Vijaya nagaram for that duration (Three and three-fourths ghatika). Subsequently he was called Vyasa raja. In fact Vyasa Raja became the raja guru of Krishna devaraya, on the recommendation of Sri Padaraja, as Sri Padaraja could not accept it due to his old age.

        There cannot be anybody in India, more so in South India, who may not know about Saint of Manthralaya – Sri Raghavendra Swamy. And he is the most popular saint among the religious devotees. It is widely believed that he takes his line from sanku karna to Prahalada to Balheeka raja to Vyasaraya to Sri Rayar.

        It is said that Sri Raghavendra shares his bountiful punya with his devout devotees in alleviating their sufferings and fulfilling their desires. It is also believed when Lakshmi Narasimha offered to give him mukthi during his Prahalada avatara, he had refused it expressing his desire that he would bring in hundreds and thousands of devotes for mukthi. Thus as Sri Raghavendra, even today he grants the desires of his devotees and alleviates their sufferings, without compromising on the imminent need to take his devotee on the path of mukthi. Thus he holds a unique place among the Madhwa saints and it may not be out of place to say that Madhwa philosophy is known more by him than anybody else with due reverence to all his guru. He is popular among all sects of people – irrespective of caste, creed or colour. It may not be surprised to say that he is global saint, given that his aradhana is celebrated across the world – be it USA, UK, Singapore, Malaysia etc.,

        It is not only Sriman Moola Rama’s/his guru’s blessings alone but also his erudite scholarship in Vedanta, Sastra, purana and ithihasas. His extra ordinary wisdom was demonstrated during his poorva Sharma days under Sri Sudheendra Theertha. As a young disciple, he could explain certain difficult postulate of Sriman Nyaya Sudha very lucidly and was rewarded with the title Sudha Parimalacharya by his Guru. His expertise and his wisdom in sashtras reflected in his 17 sub commentaries of Teeka of Sri Jayatheertha and other works like Rama Chartirya Manjaree. Krishna Charitrya Manjaree. Despite his exemplary scholarship, he has always exhibited absolute humility and attributed all his merits to his guru, parama guru and his kula deva Sri Venkatachalapathi. Hence it is said in kannada that “Devara endare Thimmappa (god means only Sri Venkatachalapathi), gurugala endare Raghappa (guru means Sri Raghavendra) in kaliyuga.

        He is the saint who entered Samadhi alive and for 700 years he would alleviate his devotee’s sufferings and grant them all desires and ultimately leading them to the path of Mukthi from his hundreds of mruttika Brundavana scattered over 3 southern states and few places in country. His aradhana day falls on Sravana Bahula Dwithiya.
